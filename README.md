# Reverse Engineering Code (Sequelize)

When joining a new team, it is expected as a new member to inspect a lot of code. Rather than having a team member explain every line, it is important to be able to dissect on your own.

## User Story
```
AS A developer
I WANT a walk-through of the codebase
SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```
